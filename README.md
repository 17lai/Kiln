# Kiln AI

> Iteratively Build High Quality ML Agents with Data

Kiln includes:

- A data platform for teams to collaborate on tasks, goals, evaluations, training data, and more. Designed for Git, providing familiar and rich tooling.
- Easy-to-use desktop apps, enabling everyone to continuously contribute to your dataset and improve quality (QA, PM, labelers, subject matter experts, etc.). One-click launch, no command line or GPU required.
- No-code data-science tools to quickly evaluate a variety of foundation models and AI techniques. Currently, we support about a dozen models and a variety of prompting solutions (few-shot, multi-shot, chain of thought), with plans for more (fine-tuning, RAG).
- An open-source Python library and REST API for data scientists and engineers to deeply integrate where needed.
- Completely private: Kiln runs locally, and we never have access to your dataset. Bring your own keys, or run locally with Ollama.

## Download Kiln Studio App


[<img width="190" alt="Download button" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fa7f887-8701-4945-be65-deced7a9b6b4">](https://github.com/Kiln-AI/Kiln/releases/latest)

The Kiln Studio desktop app is a free download, available on [MacOS and Windows](https://github.com/Kiln-AI/Kiln/releases/latest).

## Install Python Library

[![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/kiln-ai.svg?logo=pypi&label=PyPI&logoColor=gold)](https://pypi.org/project/kiln-ai/) [![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-pdoc-blue)](https://kiln-ai.github.io/Kiln/kiln_core_docs/index.html)

`pip install kiln-ai`

## What is this for?

Kiln AI is for building high quality ML agents for products. What makes product development different than standard data science is that isnâ€™t not static; no perfect dataset exists to learn from. Products are constantly evolving; bugs emerge from users, product goals change, new use-cases are added.

To solve this, Kiln makes it easy for teams to iteratively collaborate on high quality datasets, and quickly evaluate a range of AI foundation models and techniques.

#### Kiln helps your whole team continuously improve your dataset.

Our apps make it easy to continuously iterate and improve your dataset. When using the app, it automatically captures all the inputs/outputs/model parameters and everything else you need to reproduce an issue, repair the result, and capture high-quality data for multi-shot prompting or fine-tuning. QA and PM can easily identify issues sooner and help generate the dataset needed to fix the issue.

Our apps are extremely user-friendly and designed for non-technical users. This includes one-click to launch, no command line required, no GPU required, and a consumer-grade UI.

#### Kiln makes it easier to try new models and techniques.

For experimentation, Kiln includes no-code data-science tools to quickly try a variety of approaches and models in a few clicks.

These tools leverage your dataset, and the quality gets better the more you use Kiln. For example, multi-shot prompting finds the highest-rated results to use as examples.

Currently, we support about a dozen models and a variety of prompting solutions (few-shot, multi-shot, chain of thought), with plans for more models and complex techniques (fine-tuning, RAG).

#### Deep integrations with our library and REST APIs.

If you have a data science team and want to go deeper, our Python library has everything you need. Ingest the Kiln data format into your pipeline. Create custom evaluations. Use Kiln data in notebooks. Build fine-tunes. Extend or replace any part of the pipeline.

We also offer [a REST API package](https://pypi.org/project/kiln-server/) for integrating Kiln into your own tools and workflows.

## Status

Kiln is currently in alpha with plans to enter beta soon.

## License

Weâ€™re working out our license and will have it sorted soon. The plan is that the core library and REST API will be open source, so thereâ€™s zero lock-in. The desktop app will be source-available and free (as in beer).

## Development Commands

Initial setup using python environment of your choice (venv, conda, etc.):

```
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd app/web_ui
npm install
```

Run the API server, Studio server, and Studio Web UI with auto-reload for development:

- Run the Python server: `python -m app.desktop.dev_server`
- Run the Web UI from the `app/web_ui` directory: `npm run dev --`
- Open the app: http://localhost:5173/run

Running the desktop app without building an executable:

- First, build the web UI from the `app/web_ui` directory: `npm run build`
- Then run the desktop app: `python -m app.desktop.desktop`
